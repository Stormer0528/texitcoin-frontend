            young age, and got hooked. Maybe you have an important emotional attachment to your
            stack. Or, maybe you just got some bad information about digital currencies long ago.

          it's not your fault. It wasn't an error of judgement or morals. You simply didn't have
          enough good information - or time - to reach a conclusion that would have allowed you to
          engage the uncomfortable idea of investing in digital, intangible money. It's okay - it
          took me nearly 12 years to wrap my mind around crypto and accomplish the paradigm shift
          I'm asking you to achieve in the span of a single web page.`}

          yourself. Take the time you need to agree that a) crypto is the future of money and b)
          TEXITcoin is the future of crypto. If you give it a fair shot and still disagree, we'll
          part ways as friends; I'll return your original, unaltered kilo of silver, and you'll send
          back my cold storage coin.`}

          tell you that the crypto industry is fun, exciting, full of glitz & glamor, but the
          cryptokids lack real experience and desperately need our leadership. Their ideas are good,
          but what they have in youthful exuberance is offset by a desperate need for real
          substance. The kids are on to something, but they're mostly here because they smell a
          chance to get rich quick. You and I? Let's be the adults in the room and show them what
          honest money means for saving the future as we dream it.`}
