            The cryptokids got greedy; their carelessness handed over control of the bitcoin network
            to banks, megacorps & foreign nations. Today, most cryptos are centralized,
            non-mineable, and controlled by a handful of companies and foreign nations. Wallets can
            be arbitrarily frozen without due process.

            called “crypto mining”, and it's the digital equivalent of physical coin manufacturing.

            TEXITcoin returns control of the blockchain to individuals, using new hardware, a
            permissioned network, and Texas datacenters. TEXITcoin is our 2nd chance at crypto,
            returning digital currency to its original intended use of money by the people, for the
            people.
